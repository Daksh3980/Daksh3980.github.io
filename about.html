    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Sneaker Central was built by basketball lovers, for basketball lovers. We know how frustrating it is to scroll through dozens of websites full of shoes you’d never wear on the court. That’s why we created a focused space where only trusted brands, real game-ready shoes, and no clutter live.</p>

<h2>Why We Started</h2>
<p>We noticed that teens and players needed a space that felt made for them — clean, simple, and packed with performance. Whether you’re hunting for traction, bounce, ankle support or just crazy good style, we’ve got your back. Our goal is to help every hooper find the right pair without wasting time.</p>
